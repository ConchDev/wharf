## Aint this just another discord.py or hikari clone?
I see how you can think that but no. wharf was made entirely from scratch but the libraries do share stylistic choices. wharf is meant to be as minimal as possible whilst are being beginner-friendly. basically a mix of hikari and discord.py into one brand new made from scratch library!
