## Aint this just another discord.py or hikari clone?
I see how you can think that but no. wharf was made entirely from scratch but the libraries do share stylistic choices. wharf is meant to be as minimal as possible whilst are being beginner-friendly. basically a mix of hikari and discord.py into one brand new made from scratch library!

### WARNING

Alot of stuff in this library is not yet fully made. proper models, api routes, etc are mostly not yet made.

I do not recommend you use the library as is.

if you want to contribute to the development of the library, i'd be happy to allow that
